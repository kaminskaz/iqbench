        "question_image": "The 3x3 matrix exhibits various transformations both horizontally and vertically. Across the rows, there is an increasing complexity in the number of shapes present. The first row contains only two shapes per cell, the second row has three shapes, and the third row has four shapes. Additionally, there's a shift in the types of shapes from geometric figures like circles and hexagons in the first row to more varied shapes such as triangles and squares in the third row. Vertically, the size of the shapes also varies; the first column generally features larger shapes compared to the second and third columns where smaller shapes are predominant."
