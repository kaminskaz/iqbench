    "problem_description_prompt": "A standard RAVEN problem consists of a 3\u00d73 grid of images where the final cell is left blank.\nThe images evolve through systematic transformations\u2014such as rotation, progression, or logical combinations\u2014that apply consistently across rows, columns, or both. These patterns are based on visual features like shape, number, orientation, or shading.\nThe objective is to decode these horizontal and vertical rules to select the missing image from a set of options that logically completes the grid.",

    "question_prompt": "You are an expert Visual Pattern Analyst. Your task is to synthesize the provided textual description of the 3\u00d73 grid with the visual candidate options (A\u2013H) to identify the correct solution.\n\n### Instructions:\n1. **Requirement Extraction**: Extract the \"Missing Cell Specification\" from the provided text. List the mandatory attributes (morphology, orientation, chromatic properties, and relational dynamics) required for the blank (3,3) cell.\n2. **Visual Validation**: Compare the specified \"Relational Dynamics\" (nesting, overlapping, or spatial alignment shifts) against the actual visual structure of options A\u2013H.\n3. **Contrastive Elimination**: Systematically evaluate each candidate. State the specific attribute or relational failure that disqualifies a candidate. Use the labels A\u2013H for every comparison.\n4. **Convergence Check**: Ensure the chosen candidate not only matches the \"Missing Cell Specification\" but also completes the \"Horizontal and Vertical Deltas\" described in the grid analysis.\n5. **Final Selection**: Identify the single letter that represents a 100% match to the textual requirements and the visual logic.\n\n*Only use information visible in the candidate images and provided in the grid description. Do not infer any hidden rules, patterns, or details not explicitly stated.\nAnswer in less than 500 words.*",
    "describe_prompt": "You are an expert Visual Pattern Analyst. Your task is to provide a high-precision, technical description of a 3x3 visual matrix. \nYou will focus specifically on the contrastive transformations occurring across rows and columns to define the logic of the grid.\n\n### Instructions:\nUse (Row, Column) references for every description (e.g., \"Cell (2,1) contains...\").\n1. **Horizontal Delta Analysis**: Describe the step-by-step transition from the first to the third cell within each row. Identify changes in shape, quantity, orientation, and fill.\n2. **Vertical Delta Analysis**: Describe the transition from the top to the bottom cell within each column. Note if the changes reinforce or differ from the horizontal patterns.\n3. **Attribute Inventory**: For every cell, specify the exact morphology (sides/vertices), orientation (degrees/direction), and chromatic properties (fill/border).\n4. **Relational Dynamics**: Detail how internal elements interact within a cell\u2014specifically focusing on nesting, overlapping, or spatial alignment shifts across the grid.\n5. **Missing Cell Specification**: Based on the established row/column contrasts, list the required visual properties for the blank (3,3) cell.\n\n*Only use information visible in the image. Do not assume hidden rules or patterns that aren't clearly shown.\nAnswer in less than 500 words.*",
