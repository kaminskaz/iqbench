    "problem_description_prompt": "A standard RAVEN problem consists of a 3×3 grid of images where the final cell is left blank.\nThe images evolve through systematic transformations—such as rotation, progression, or logical combinations—that apply consistently across rows, columns, or both. These patterns are based on visual features like shape, number, orientation, or shading.\nThe objective is to decode these horizontal and vertical rules to select the missing image from a set of options that logically completes the grid.",

Your task is solve a RAVEN puzzle based on the entire problem image.\n\n### Instructions:\nDetermine the correct candidate (A, B, C, or D) for the missing cell by identifying the unified transformational logic governing the horizontal rows and vertical columns of the 3x3 grid.\n\n*Only use information visible in the images. Do not assume hidden rules or patterns that aren't clearly shown. Answer in less than 500 words.*",

(1.0 meaning absolutely confident, 0.5 meaning not so sure, 0 meaning purely guessing)\n- rationale: Short version of the rationale for your answer.\n\n### Example 1:\n{\n\"answer\": \"H\",\n\"confidence\": 0.96,\n\"rationale\": \"Across each row, the shape gains one additional element from left to right, and the missing panel must continue this progression. Option H correctly adds the next element while preserving shape type and orientation, unlike the other options.\"\n}\n\n### Example 2:\n{\n\"answer\": \"A\",\n\"confidence\": 0.91,\n\"rationale\": \"In each column, the pattern alternates between filled and outlined shapes while maintaining the same geometry. Option A is the only choice that matches this alternating fill rule and the established spatial alignment.\"\n}",
