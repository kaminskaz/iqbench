Do not assume hidden rules or patterns that aren't clearly shown. Answer in less than 500 words.*",

(1.0 meaning absolutely confident, 0.5 meaning not so sure, 0.0 meaning purely guessing, etc.)\n- rationale: Short version of the rationale for your answer.\n\n### Example 1:\n{\n    \"answer\": \"Multiple objects vs. Single object\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.97,\n    \"rationale\": \"All images in the Left panel contain more than one distinct object, while every image in the Right panel contains exactly one object, with no exceptions across the panels.\",\n}\n\n### Example 2:\n{\n    \"answer\": \"Filled shapes vs. Outlined shapes\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.95,\n    \"rationale\": \"All images in the Left panel contain at least one filled shape, whereas every image in the Right panel consists only of outlined shapes, with no filled regions present.\"\n}\n",
