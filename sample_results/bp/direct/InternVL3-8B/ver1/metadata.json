Your task is to solve a Bongard Problem puzzle.\n\n### Instructions:\n1. **Extract Left-Side Invariants**: Identify one visual property shared by all six images on the **Left**. Check for:\n- Elements: Types of shapes, lines, or points.\n- Properties: Size, orientation, fill, or closure.\n- Numbers: Count of items, vertices, or intersections.\n- Relations: Containment, touching, alignment, or distance.\n2. **Test Against Right-Side Counter-examples**: Verify that the identified property is absent or violated in every image on the **Right**.\n3. **Refine at the Boundary**: Compare the images that look most similar across both sides. Isolate the specific visual detail that separates them to sharpen your rule.\n4. **Finalize Rule**: Formulate a concise logic statement: \"Left rule vs. Right rule\"\n\n*Only use information visible in the images. Do not assume hidden rules or patterns that aren't clearly shown. Answer in less than 500 words.*",
