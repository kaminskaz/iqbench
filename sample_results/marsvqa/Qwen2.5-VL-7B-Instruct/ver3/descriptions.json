Both have Blue squares.\n- C vs. D: C is the only image with two stars, and the only image where a shape type is represented by two colors (Red and Blue stars). D is the only image with a Red triangle and a Blue star/square combination. Both contain no Dark Green shapes and two Blue shapes.\n**Relative Position**:\nThe shapes' relative positions are generally consistent across the images, with one shape centered at the top and two shapes positioned below it, forming an approximately inverted triangle:\n- The top shape is always a star (A, B, C) or a square (D).\n- In A, the Red star is at the top.\n- In B, the Blue square is at the top.\n- In C, the Red star is at the top.\n- In D, the Blue square is at the top.\n- The two bottom shapes are always a combination of the other two shapes/colors.\n"

        "question_image": "Contrasts and Differences\n\n### Row Analysis\n1. **Row 1**: The first row consists of shapes that are primarily blue and green. Each row starts with a curved shape and ends with a small, rounded shape. The central shape varies: a circle in the first column, a circle in the second column, and a smaller circle in the third column.\n2. **Row 2**: This row also consists of blue and green shapes. The sequence is similar to the first row, starting with a curved shape, followed by a central shape which appears to be a circle in the second column, and ending with a small, rounded shape.\n3. **Row 3**: The third row follows a similar pattern, with shapes that are predominantly blue and green. The central shape in this row is a larger circle compared to the previous rows.\n\n### Column Analysis\n1. **Column 1**: All three columns start with a curved shape that resembles a semicircle or a crescent. The central shape in this column is consistently a circle, and the final shape is a small, rounded shape.\n2. **Column 2**: The central shape in this column is a circle for all three rows. The first and third rows end with a small, rounded shape, while the second row ends with a larger circle.\n3. **Column 3**: The central shape in this column is a circle for all three rows. The first and second rows end with a small, rounded shape, while the third row ends with a larger circle.\n\n### Spatial and Chromatic Transformations\n- **Spatial Transformation**: The shapes maintain a consistent position within their respective rows and columns, with the central shape being the most prominent feature.\n- **Chromatic Transformation**: The primary colors used are blue and green, with variations in size and shape. The color scheme remains relatively constant across rows and columns, with minor changes in the size and type of shapes.\n\n### Summary\nThe matrix exhibits a consistent spatial arrangement with a recurring pattern of shapes, where the central circular shape is a key element. The colors blue and green dominate, with slight variations in the size and type of the shapes, particularly the central circular shape and the small rounded shape at the end of each row and column."
