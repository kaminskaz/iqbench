094,D,"Upon analyzing the image, it is evident that images A, B, and C all feature irregular, organic shapes without distinct geometric features like triangles. Image D, however, contains a small, distinct triangular component within its shape, which sets it apart. This triangle is not present in the other images, making it the outlier. The reasoning for answer B is incorrect as all images do contain shapes; answer C is incorrect because none of the images are completely black; and answer D related to internal voids is not applicable since the shapes in A, B, and C do not have internal voids. The consensus among the ensemble correctly identifies D as the odd one out based on the presence of the triangular component.","{'final_answer': 'D', 'rationale': 'Upon analyzing the image, it is evident that images A, B, and C all feature irregular, organic shapes without distinct geometric features like triangles.
