098,C,"The correct answer is option C. Here's the detailed analysis of the visual patterns and the rationale for selecting option C over other candidates based on the visual features present in the grid.

1. **Shape Consistency Across Rows and Columns**:
   - In the first row, the first column contains triangles, and the second column contains hexagons. The third column contains circles. The shapes in each column are consistent.
   - In the second row, the first column contains circles, and the second column contains hexagons. The third column contains circles. The shapes in the first and third columns are consistent, while the second column shows hexagons.
   - In the third row, the first column contains hexagons, the second column contains squares, and the third column contains circles.
   - The pattern shows that the first and third columns maintain consistent shapes across rows, while the second column changes.

2. **Color Transition**:
   - The colors transition from black to gray to white as we move from left to right in each row.
   - In the first row, the first column is black, the second is gray, and the third is white.
   - In the second row, the first column is black, the second is gray, and the third is white.
   - In the third row, the first column is gray, the second is black, and the third is white.
   - This color transition is consistent across the rows.

3. **Shape and Color in the Missing Cell**:
   - The missing cell in the third row, third column should follow the pattern of consistent shapes and color transition.
   - The third column in the third row has a gray hexagon in the first and second cells. The third cell should be consistent with the first and second cells, which is a gray shape.
   - The shape in the third column is a hexagon, and the color should be gray.
   - Option C matches these criteria with a gray triangle, which fits the transition pattern and the shape consistency.

4. **Evaluating Other Candidates**:
   - **Option B**: Suggests a pattern of increasing hexagons in size and consistent color changes, which does not align with the observed consistent shapes in the third column.
   - **Option F**: Proposes an alternating filled/unfilled pattern, which does not match the observed shape and color consistency.

   - **Option H**: Suggests a pattern of alternating shapes and colors, which does not align with the consistent shapes and color patterns in the grid.
