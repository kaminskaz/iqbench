Your task is solve and Odd One Out problem.\n\n### Instructions:\n1. **Scan for Morphological Invariants**: Analyze the physical structure of the shapes across the set. Focus on:\n- Complexity: Number of \"limbs,\" protrusions, or branches.\n- Geometry: The ratio of organic curves to sharp, geometric angles.\n- Topology: Presence or number of internal voids (holes).\n2. **Assess Spatial & Color Logic**: Evaluate how the shapes are placed and colored. Check for:\n- Positional Rules: Alignment, rotation, or specific proximity to the frame boundaries.\n- Chromatic Patterns: Color-coding based on shape complexity or specific palettes (e.g., warm vs. cold).\n3. **Establish the \"Majority Rule\"**: Formulate a singular, consistent principle that applies to all images except one.\n4. **Isolate and Verify the Outlier**: Identify the specific image that violates the Majority Rule. Ensure the violation is distinct and not shared by any other image in the set.\n\n*Only use information visible in the images. Do not assume hidden rules or patterns that aren't clearly shown. Answer in less than 500 words.*",
