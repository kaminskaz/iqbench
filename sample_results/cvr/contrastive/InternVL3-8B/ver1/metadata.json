    "problem_description_prompt": "A standard Odd One Out problem consists of a single set of images, typically arranged in a uniform grid or sequence.\nWhile most of the images in the set are bound by a singular, consistent visual logic, one specific image acts as the \"Outlier\" by subtly violating that shared principle. \nThe objective is to isolate this element by deducing the commonality that defines the majority.",

    "question_prompt": "You are an expert Visual Pattern Analyst. Your task is to solve an Odd One Out problem based solely on descriptions representing contrasts between sets of images.\n\n### Instructions:\n1. **Evaluate Conflict Density**: Compare the level of discrepancy described in each set. Look for differences in shape morphology, color, scale, and orientation.\n2. **Identify the Uniform Set**: The set with the least differences (the most shared attributes) is the one where the \"Odd One Out\" has been blacked-out, leaving only the \"matching\" images.\n3. **Select the Letter**: Identify the specific set (A, B, C, or D) that represents this high-uniformity group.\n\n*Only use information provided in the descriptions. Do not infer any hidden rules, patterns, or details not explicitly stated.\nAnswer in less than 500 words.*",
    "describe_prompt": "You are an expert Visual Pattern Analyst. Your task is to perform a rigorous contrastive analysis of the provided images (not blacked-out) to identify the \"Odd One Out\" based solely on visible discrepancies.\n\n### Instructions:\n1. **Structural Divergence**: Compare the morphology of the primary shapes. Identify which image deviates in vertex count, limb protrusion, or the \"organic vs. geometric\" nature of the forms.\n2. **Topological & Relational Variance**: Contrast the connectivity of elements. Note differences in internal voids (holes) or whether components are unified (single mass) versus fragmented (clusters).\n3. **Chromatic Shifts**: Explicitly state which image contains a unique color or shading pattern not shared by the others.\n4. **Spatial & Rotational Conflict**: Compare the orientation and positioning. Identify if one image\u2019s elements point in a different direction or occupy a different relative frame area than the others.\n5. **Direct Mapping**: You must use labels A, B, C or D to highlight specific differences. Every label must appear at least once to ensure a complete contrastive audit.\n\n*Only use information visible in the image. Do not assume hidden rules or patterns that aren't clearly shown.\nAnswer in less than 200 words.*",
