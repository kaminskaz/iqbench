    "problem_description_prompt": "A standard Odd One Out problem consists of a single set of images, typically arranged in a uniform grid or sequence.\nWhile most of the images in the set are bound by a singular, consistent visual logic, one specific image acts as the \"Outlier\" by subtly violating that shared principle. \nThe objective is to isolate this element by deducing the commonality that defines the majority.",

Your task is to solve an Odd One Out problem based solely on descriptions representing contrasts between sets of images.\n\n### Instructions:\nIdentify which set (A, B, C, or D) exhibits the highest level of internal uniformity among its described images, indicating that the 'Odd One Out' element is the one currently blacked-out.\n\n*Only use information provided in the descriptions. Do not infer any hidden rules, patterns, or details not explicitly stated.\nAnswer in less than 500 words.*",
    "describe_prompt": "You are an expert Visual Pattern Analyst. Your task is to perform a rigorous contrastive analysis of the provided images (not blacked-out) to identify the \"Odd One Out\" based solely on visible discrepancies.\n\n### Instructions:\nProvide a direct contrastive analysis of the visible images by identifying all objective visual differences regarding object attributes, spatial configurations, colors and feature counts.\n\n*Only use information visible in the image. Do not assume hidden rules or patterns that aren't clearly shown.\nAnswer in less than 200 words.*",

Letter (A-D) identifying the set without an odd image (least differences, most commonalities) based on descriptions of versions of the problem with one image blacked out.\n- confidence: Confidence in your answer, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. (1.0 meaning absolutely confident, 0.5 meaning not so sure, 0 meaning purely guessing, etc.)\n- rationale: Short version of the rationale for your answer.\n\n### Example 1:\n{\n    \"answer\": \"B\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.97,\n    \"rationale\": \"Image B is the odd one out because all other images contain shapes of the same color, while image B includes shapes of two different colors, breaking the shared color-consistency rule.\",\n}\n\n### Example 2:\n{\n    \"answer\": \"D\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.85,\n    \"rationale\": \"Image D is the odd one out because the remaining images contain single centered shape, whereas image D contains multiple shapes, violating the common structure.\"\n}",

One field:\n- description: Detailed description of differences and similarities between images that have not been blacked out.\n\n### Example:\n{\n    \"description\": Image A is entirely blacked out. Image B, C, and D contain multiple outlined shapes on a white background, all within a black border. Images B and C each show three main shapes, while Image D shows four. In Image B, the shapes are outlined in red (burgundy/maroon). In Image C, the shapes are outlined in purple/indigo. In Image D, the shapes are outlined in green. All visible shapes across B, C, and D appear to be polygons of roughly the same relative size and shape within their respective images, maintaining similar relative positions (e.g., one larger shape on the right, and smaller ones on the left and bottom). The shapes in D seem slightly more prominent or thicker than those in B and C.”,\n}"
