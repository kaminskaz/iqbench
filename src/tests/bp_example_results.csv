"001",Empty picture vs Not empty picture,0.99,"Let's analyze the images step by step to determine the underlying rule that separates the left side from the right side. The left side consists of six images, and each of these images appears to be composed solely of shapes without any lines. This means that the boundaries of the shapes are defined by curves or edges, but there are no straight lines present within or between the shapes. For example, the first image on the left is entirely filled with a single square, and the second image has a circle and a square, both of which do not have any lines inside them. Similarly, the third image has a squiggly line, but the line itself is not a straight line; it is a continuous curve. The fourth image contains a series of dots, which are points rather than lines. The fifth image has a star, and the sixth image has a collection of small circles, squares, and triangles, none of which contain lines. In contrast, the right side consists of six images, and each of these images contains at least one line. For instance, the first image on the right has a circle and a square, where the square is defined by straight lines. The second image has a squiggly line, but this line is not a straight line; it is a continuous curve. The third image has a series of dots, which can be considered as points rather than lines. The fourth image has a star, and the star itself is made up of straight lines. The fifth image contains a collection of small circles, squares, and triangles, where some of the shapes are defined by straight lines. Therefore, the rule that separates the left side from the right side is that all images on the left have no lines, while all images on the right have lines."""
"002",Solid color vs Transparent color,1,"To analyze the rule, I observed the color of each shape in both sets. The left set contains shapes filled with a solid color, whereas the right set contains shapes with transparent colors. This difference is consistent across all images in both sets."
