"000","C",0.92,"To solve this puzzle, I'll start by analyzing the shapes, colors, and positions of the elements in each square. The shapes appear to be irregular and abstract, with no clear common shape. The colors are distinct in each square, but they do not seem to be following a specific color rule. The positions of the shapes also vary, making it difficult to determine a positional pattern. However, the sizes of the shapes appear consistent across the squares. Therefore, the odd one out is likely to be the one where the size of the shapes differs from the others."
